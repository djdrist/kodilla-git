        <h1>Rihanna - Stay</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>All along it was a fever<br>
            A cold sweat, hot headed believer<br>
            I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"<br>
            He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"</p>
        <p>Round and around and around and around we go<br>
            Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know</p>
        <p>Not really sure how to feel about it<br>
            Something in the way you move<br>
            Makes me feel like I can't live without you<br>
            It takes me all the way<br>
            I want you to stay</p>
        <p>It's not much of a life you're living<br>
            It's not just something you take, it's given</p>
        <p>Round and around and around and around we go<br>
            Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know</p>
        <p>Not really sure how to feel about it<br>
            Something in the way you move<br>
            Makes me feel like I can't live without you<br>
            It takes me all the way<br>
            And I want you to stay</p>
        <p>Ooh, the reason I hold on<br>
            Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone<br>
            Well, funny you're the broken one<br>
            But I'm the only one who needed saving<br>
            'Cause when you never see the light<br>
            It's hard to know which one of us is caving</p>
        <p>Not really sure how to feel about it<br>
            Something in the way you move<br>
            Makes me feel like I can't live without you<br>
            It takes me all the way<br>
            I want you to stay<br>
            Stay<br>
            I want you to stay<br>
            Ooh</p>
